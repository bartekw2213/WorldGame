# WorldGame :earth_africa:

WorldGame is a project created for my OOP classes. It's created in a pure Java with a little bit of Swing library and is a turn-based game. 

Everytime we run the program for the first time we start with a player placed on the board, a few animals (like wolfes, sheeps, turtles etc.)
and also several plants (like guarana, grass etc.) In every round each of animals move, interact with each other (breed or fight), while plants
are trying to spread their seeds across the board.

Each animal and plant species has their own power, initiative indicating when it can move and unique behaviour - for example antelope has 50%
chance to avoid fight and cyber-sheep always goes towards Sosnowsky's hogweed.
